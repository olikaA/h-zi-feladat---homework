	Dear Sir/Madam!


The homework you send me, has been solved in two different ways by me. The reason of this: I didn't know exactly which method should I do, so I made in two different ways.

The first method was a database-based solution, the other one is a non-database-based solution.

Both separated solution has it's own (README - HUN or ENG). Please read it all, because they contain important informations about the file's opening method.

It's important to note that the description wasn't created of the reason "derogatory". Only, because of avoiding any kind of misunderstanding and 
to make the file's opening method easier and faster.

I wish you a happy fix!

Oliver
